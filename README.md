# Cluster-Analysis
### Description: 
This repository contains some of the cluster analysis I have performed during my studies, grouped in 8 assignments.
Here are attached the assignments with certain tasks to accomplish with their answers containing chunks of code in R.

### Aim: 
to practice with some of the main algorithms of unsupervised classification (Cluster Analysis).
Please note that the pdf's have been created using R markdown to better combine LaTeX with the R code.

### Used methods and algorithms: 
K-Means, clusering based on simple mathching distance, Jaccard, and correlation dissimilarity, Gower coefficient, visualization with multi-dimensional scaling and pairs plots and dendrograms, Rand Index, hierarchical clustering (agglomerative and divisive), simple-complete-average linkage, Ward's method, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), model-based clustering like Gaussian Mixture models, Covariance-matrix models, EM-Algorithm, clustering on mixture of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, a mixture model for categorical data, Silhouette function, BIC, AIC, clustering on functional data with mixtures of distributions, B-Splines, Fisher's LDA,
